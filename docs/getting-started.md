# Welcome to Mu-Pipelines!

This guide will help you set up and run Mu-Pipelines.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Mu-Pipelines
Ensure you have Python 3 installed, then run:

```sh
pip install mu-pipelines

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create Config Files
Our config files are divided into two sections: `execute` and `destination`.

### Configuration Parameters:
- **execute-xx**: This can be ingesting data from a source or transforming using SQL/Python.

Refer to the config documentation for a list of available `execute` and `destination` commands.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run a Sample Config File
In your notebook or Python file, add the following code:

```python
from mu_pipelines_driver.run_config import run_config

df = run_config(
    [
        {
            "execution": [
                {
                    "type": "CSVReadCommand",
                    "file_location": "/home/iceberg/data/file/people.csv",
                    "delimiter": ",",
                    "quotes": "\"",
                    "additional_attributes": [

            ],
            "destination": [
                {
                    "type": "table",
                    "table_name": "crm.raw.people",

                }
